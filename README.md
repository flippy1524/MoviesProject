# MoviesProject
A basic example of a Netflix equivalent project using themoviedb's database 
https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started

It uses the guest functionality as a base to fetch the data from the API 

# Core features
- Different environments based on scheme selection
- Securely kept urls,tokens etc in info.plist
- 


# Todo's
- Add prefetching by adding a splash screen and navigate the user to the correct page with prefetched data
- Cache the content instead of fetching it from the endpoints
